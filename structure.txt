DATA:
- ATAC-seq signal
- ALL kinds of features ((hrde-1 score, H3K9, mRNA level...)


Function to calculate ATAC_contin_param for all genes:
- choose range: -500:-100
- choose experiment: exp1 / exp_gonads / exp_hrde_gonads / exp_hrde_guy / exp_metsetset
- Normalize: to highly_lowly / none
- choose "treated" condition: gfp / oma-1 / hrde-1 / sx / metsetset / 
- Mean 3 all replicates? : yes or seperately?
- log2 FC
- median
returns a table/dic, for each gene the value of paramaters

** To test the range: it can be interesting to plot a correlation between the range of 500:100 to a range of 150-450 for instance. 
** To test the normalization: plot a correlation between results with and without normalization


Function to get list of desired genes:
- groups from table: by ATAC_bigtable (hrde-1 score, H3K9, mRNA level...)
- a set of the most / least 10% of ATAC_contin_param for a desired condition (choose percentage)


Function plot ATAC-seq signal. Choose:
- Experiment: exp1 / exp_gonads / exp_hrde_gonads / exp_hrde_guy / exp_metsetset
- Normalize: to highly_lowly / none
- Mean 3 all replicates? : yes or seperately?
    - STD size?
- Plot


Test models:
- Can we predict "strange genes" from one of the features?
